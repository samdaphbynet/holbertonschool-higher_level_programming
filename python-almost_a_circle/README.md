# Python - Almost a circle

## Step by step
- Write the first class Base
- Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base
- Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded)
- Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance
- Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you don’t need to handle x and y here
- Update the class Rectangle by overriding the str method so that it returns [Rectangle] instance
- Update the class Rectangle by improving the public method def display(self): to print in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # by taking care of x and y
- Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def update(self, *args): that assigns an argument to each attribute
- Update the class Rectangle by updating the public method def update(self, *args): by changing the prototype to update(self, *args, kwargs) that assigns a key/value argument to attributes
- Write the class Square that inherits from Rectangle
- Update the class Square by adding the public getter and setter size
- Update the class Square by adding the public method def update(self, *args, kwargs) that assigns attributes
- Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Rectangle
- Update the class Square by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Square
- Update the class Base by adding the class method def savetofile(cls, listobjs): that writes the JSON string representation of listobjs to a file
- Update the class Base by adding the static method def fromjsonstring(jsonstring): that returns the list of the JSON string representation jsonstring
- Update the class Base by adding the class method def create(cls, dictionary): that returns an instance with all attributes already set
- Update the class Base by adding the class method def loadfromfile(cls): that returns a list of instances
